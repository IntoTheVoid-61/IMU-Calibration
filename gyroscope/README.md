# IMU-Calibration Gyroscope

## Description
Running this script is very self explanatory if you take the time to read the code. No use of magneto software is required for this step. 



## Note
Gyroscope bias is time dependant so this is not very reliable for long term applications.
For initial bias estimation, or for sensor fusion applications this a relatively decent approximations
